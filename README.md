# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project to analyze Pewlett Hackard employee database using PostgreSQL to help the company anticipate the "silver tsunami" as many current employees will leave to retirement. We will determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results:
- 30% of current employees could potentially retire over the next 4 years. An average of 18,000 per year.

- The Development and Production department will be impacted the most representing more than half of the retiring employees.

- The majority of the employees that were retiring held senior-level positions.

- 1,549 employees could be eligible for the mentorship program. If we assume that they will all be willing to participate in the mentorship program, it will imply that each mentor would have an average of 58 mentees, so we can conclude that there is not enough mentors to prepare the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

## Summary:
Based on the results, 72,458 current employees are categorized as "silver tsunami" which represents 30% of their current workforce and an average of 18,000 per year. Majority of the "retirees" hold senior-level positions which will impact Pewlett Hackard significantly, not only in having to go through the recruiting process to fill these positions, but the senior-level knowledge that these retirees will take with them as well. The Development and Production department would be impacted the most with 49% of the retiring employees currently working in these departments. There may not exactly be enough people in the workforce to take care of the tasks or even come close to the amount of experience to fill these roles so quickly but what companies can do is take this analysis to communicate the benefits of creating a Mentorship Program. Some of the key benefits would be retaining experienced and successful employees that can transfer their knowledge to those less experienced and reducing the impact of having a high volume of employees leaving in a given year.
